# weatherapp
 Weather app is fetching weather details from OpenWeatherMap api and showing the details of the weather.

- Minimum support iOS Version 14.0
- SwiftUI + MVVM + Combine
- Realm database

Note: Kindly check it on a real iphone device for better results. Otherwise you can check it in the simulator as well but you have to give the user location through xcode to see the weather details.
